LOOKABOUT 

LOOKABOUT is a 2D game categorized as a dungeon crawl. In this game, the protagonist explores a dimly lit labyrinth of rooms, searching for the key to escape while armed 
with only a time-sensitive flashlight. Players must confront terrifying adversaries and scavenge for flashlight batteries. The game adheres to the horror concept of Scream-Jam, 
where threats lurk in the shadows and can strike at any moment. The constant fear of the flashlight running out before finding the key adds to the overall horror experience. 
Being lost within the maze intensifies the eerie atmosphere. What sets this game apart is its dynamic map generation, ensuring a fresh experience each time you play. 

  

Game controls are straightforward: use the directional keys (A, W, S, D) to maneuver through the maze. 
A moves you left, W moves you up, S moves you down, and D moves you right. To manipulate the flashlight, 
simply move your mouse in the desired direction to illuminate objects in the dungeon. Collectibles can be 
obtained by standing over them, but getting caught by a monster ends the game. Once you locate the key, 
you must return to the starting point and use it to unlock the dungeon door and escape.
